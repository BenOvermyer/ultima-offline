  [15:42:41] * mrod has done it again ^_^. he didn't realize he was talking with 
  another member of the team ^_^. now he'll learn the member names and repeat 
  ten times, so he can avoid doing this again :-D<br>
  <strong>[15:43:09] &lt;Tamino&gt; anybody recognize what's on the URL? ;)</strong><br>
  [15:43:40] &lt;Nadir&gt; Members: wjp, Colourless, Nadir, Fingolfin, freedman, 
  Dominik<br>
  [15:44:12] &lt;mrod&gt; :-)<br>
  [15:44:33] &lt;Nadir&gt; I've never played UOL... <br>
  <strong>[15:45:09] &lt;Tamino&gt; I am creating a server for the old, old pre-alpha 
  client<br>
  [15:45:32] &lt;Tamino&gt; in my opinion, the best client of them all :)</strong><br>
  [15:45:43] * mrod is happy now, timidity works ^_^<br>
  [15:45:58] &lt;Nadir&gt; mrod: generallly if they have IRC op status they are 
  part of the Exult team. <br>
  [15:46:02] &lt;Nadir&gt; Apart from chimera<br>
  [15:46:04] &lt;Nadir&gt; :)<br>
  [15:46:50] &lt;Nadir&gt; Tamino: I had the pre alpha. But it was unusable from 
  Europe...<br>
  <strong>[15:47:40] &lt;Tamino&gt; welp, I'm ressurecting it! :)<br>
  [15:47:48] &lt;Tamino&gt; usable from everywhere... hehe</strong><br>
  [15:48:38] &lt;Nadir&gt; Can you still grab hold of it ?<br>
  <strong>[15:48:52] &lt;Tamino&gt; not really<br>
  [15:48:57] &lt;Tamino&gt; but I will make it available</strong><br>
  [15:49:08] &lt;Nadir&gt; mrod: how's that Exult music now ?<br>
  [15:50:50] &lt;mrod&gt; Nadir: great ! i was very unhappy with the lack of music 
  in the linux version<br>
  [15:51:37] &lt;Nadir&gt; Do you have digital sfx ?<br>
  [15:51:51] &lt;Nadir&gt; tamino: did the pre-alpha have sound ?<br>
  [15:52:00] &lt;Tamino&gt; yessir<br>
  [15:52:09] &lt;mrod&gt; Nadir: hmm, i fear i don't :-(<br>
  <strong>[15:55:47] &lt;Tamino&gt; anyone here know of a good, light-weight webboard?</strong><br>

  [18:45:31] --&gt; wjp has joined #exult<br>
  [18:45:41] &lt;wjp&gt; hi<br>
  [18:45:59] &lt;mrod&gt; hello<br>
  [18:46:48] * wjp takes a peek at that UO server page<br>
  <strong>[19:10:27] &lt;Tamino&gt; you looked at my project?</strong><br>
  [19:10:42] &lt;wjp&gt; briefly, yes<br>
  <strong>[19:11:40] &lt;Tamino&gt; sorry about all the naked gimps ;)</strong><br>
  [19:11:55] &lt;wjp&gt; :-)<br>
  [19:12:02] &lt;wjp&gt; clothing not implemented yet? :-)<br>
  <strong>[19:12:04] &lt;Tamino&gt; haven't got the equipment packets figured 
  out.<br>
  [19:12:12] &lt;Tamino&gt; exactly<br>
  [19:12:51] &lt;Tamino&gt; the characters you might have seen that are clothed 
  are really full animations, rather than totally modular as most players/NPC's<br>
  [19:12:59] &lt;Tamino&gt; I'm working on it ;)</strong><br>
  [19:13:54] &lt;wjp&gt; I played UO for a month last year, and the beta for a 
  while. It's kind of addictive, somehow<br>
  <strong>[19:15:45] &lt;Tamino&gt; I think the pre-alpha has qualities that make 
  it a lot more fun than the current versions.</strong><br>
  [19:16:34] &lt;wjp&gt; such as?<br>
  <strong>[19:16:35] &lt;Tamino&gt; beta was great, too</strong><br>
  [19:17:00] &lt;wjp&gt; (never seen the (pre-)alpha)<br>
  <strong>[19:17:15] &lt;Tamino&gt; check this out - http://www.andrew.net/uol/<br>
  [19:17:46] &lt;Tamino&gt; starting with quests, for one... the pre-alpha had 
  the best quest ever associated with UO</strong><br>
  [19:18:10] &lt;wjp&gt; quests? oh... those 'go kill someone' quests every NPC 
  was offering in the beta :-)<br>
  [19:18:17] &lt;wjp&gt; (that was _so_ broken when I played it :-) )<br>
  <strong>[19:18:40] &lt;Tamino&gt; you had to delve into a crypt, go into a maze 
  of doors and switches, and finally be led to Myndon's tower to defeat a mage, 
  finally receiving a fire wand/macea</strong><br>
  <strong>[19:19:04] &lt;Tamino&gt; no, no, nothing like those stupid &quot;quests&quot; 
  that were in the beta</strong><br>
  [19:19:42] &lt;wjp&gt; sounds a lot more interesting, but a bit unfeasable when 
  too many people are around<br>
  <strong>[19:20:34] &lt;Tamino&gt; oh, it's no problem... parties had to go in 
  and do it, and they had to be very tough<br>
  [19:21:35] &lt;Tamino&gt; I'm going to create many more quests than that. The 
  pre-alpha map, though, is quite small, so I am also considering extending it.</strong><br>
  <strong>[19:22:25] &lt;Tamino&gt; you'll also notice that this is level-based, 
  as well as skilled based. I think that was also a nice quality.<br>
  [19:22:43] &lt;Tamino&gt; pre-alpha has a special place in my heart, too... 
  it was like a golden age, back then<br>
  [19:23:52] &lt;Tamino&gt; there are some very neat areas of the map... parts 
  of this map look more advanced than the current UO...<br>
  [19:24:29] &lt;Tamino&gt; multi-level buildings are all over the place, and 
  some are highly integrated with the 3d terrain, rather than basically all being 
  on flat tiles.<br>
  [19:24:58] * wjp takes a look at some more screenshots<br>
  [19:25:32] &lt;Tamino&gt; most of the shots I've taken don't show any of that, 
  yet, though.<br>
  [19:26:51] &lt;Tamino&gt; it's notable also that the code for the clients after 
  this one was started from scratch</strong><br>
  [19:27:21] &lt;wjp&gt; I see...<br>
  [19:27:29] &lt;wjp&gt; code must've been pretty bad then :-)<br>
  <strong>[19:30:11] &lt;Tamino&gt; no, it's not bad at all<br>
  [19:30:23] &lt;Tamino&gt; there are minimal bugs</strong><br>
  [19:30:48] &lt;wjp&gt; really? why did they rewrite it then? design issues?<br>
  <strong>[19:30:52] &lt;Tamino&gt; they just wanted to take what they had learned 
  and build a foundation for a more robust system</strong><br>
  [19:31:03] &lt;wjp&gt; ah<br>
  <strong>[19:31:39] &lt;Tamino&gt; as in, this client and the official server 
  (now lost to the abyss) wouldn't have been efficient on the massive scale except 
  with heavy modifications</strong><br>
  [22:01:21] &lt;-- Tamino has left IRC (Is not the arrow behind thee?) </font>
