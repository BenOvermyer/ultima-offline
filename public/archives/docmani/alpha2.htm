<H1 align=center>The Second Pre-Alpha</H1>
<P>This one was a little shorter because I couldn't play very much, but 
enjoy!</P>
<P>I'm not sure what the deal is, as far as if there is a new map or anything. 
I'm hoping a couple of my friends can get passwords for UO. If so, I might 
actually consider forming a solid group, rather than the 'group o' adventurers' 
that we had in the last round. Everybody's grandmother seems to be doing this 
however, and I've always liked to be original. If I think of something both 
interesting and appropriate, I'll put it here, so check back. If anyone else has 
any ideas, feel free to email me. If anything, I found the 'safety in numbers' 
thing works fairly well on UO. I plan to keep this going.</P>
<P>The Order of the Avatar didn't go very well. People didn't seem to 
interested. A pity.</P>
<P>So, what have I been doing? Just wandering around. Helping people out. Is it 
me, or are people getting more rude online? I have chased after more thieves and 
PKers than I can count. I was giving my buddy some armor and this guy comes 
along, picks it up, and runs off with it. I chased after him and he has the 
NERVE to ask people for help because, "some nut" was chasing him. A PKer did the 
same thing. He didn't have any armor and was attacking people with armor. One 
person asked me for help. He ran off. He then attacked someone else, who also 
asked me for help. I asked the guy to stop, to get his side of the story, and he 
ran off. I chased him. Fortunately, he ran right into an orc captain. That 
pretty much ruined his day.</P>
<P>Other news: They shut the quest down. They collected all the fireball wands. 
Speaking as someone who had one during the last test, I must say, I have to 
agree with the decision. They were a little too powerful. If you were powerful 
enough to complete the quest without a wand, then you really didn't need one. 
But, it does suck because the quest was alot of fun. It also looks like they 
shut the knight generators down. That also sucks.</P></BODY>
