the many questions I've been asked about this map, this map was copied from the 
original UO web site that used to be at www.owo.com. It was taken around the 
time of the pre-alpha. I think Origin's original intention was to have multiple 
continents in UO, rather than the same continent on multiple shards. This idea 
didn't seem to last very long though.

<H1>Ultima Online - Shattered Legacy</H1></CENTER>I have officially left UO, 
please read the news item below. These pages are now defunct, however they may 
still contain some useful info. 
<H2>Docmani's Guide to Ultima Online</H2>I am compiled a <A 
href="http://www.glue.umd.edu/~docmani/uo/guide/guide.html">guide</A> to Ultima 
Online using many resources, as well as my own experience. There are many guides 
geared towards newbies, other guides that have statistics. This is meant to be a 
guide for both old and new players alike. Take a look! Readers are warned some 
of this information may be out of date. 
<P>
<H2>News Items (Updated 10/1/98):</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>(10/1/98) - Its been real. I went and looked back. April 8, 1996. After 
  that day, I had such high hopes, however I can honestly say I'm finished. I 
  haven't played UO in almost three months. I'm just throwing away money at 
  Origin now. I just officially threw in the towel a few minutes ago. Why? Well, 
  I just looked at the UO web page. I read about 'the second age'. I read about 
  all the new stuff and features and things. That alone was enough to make me 
  cancel. Its been a whole year since the beta test. I don't like where UO has 
  gone. Its nothing but a glorified chat room now, and the new expansion merely 
  sounds like more space for houses and more space to hunt. During the beta 
  test, there was an attempt at a quest engine where people would ask you for 
  particular items and tell you about people who might have those items. It 
  never worked quite right, but heck, I could see how a more complicated system 
  would be alot of fun. They tried putting in other types of quests such as 
  escort quests etc, however they were all cookie cutter type deals where once 
  you had done them, they were all the same. They then introduced seers and 
  other such quests. Again, a good try, however in the year that I have been 
  playing UO I have seen ONE seer. In a game with thousands online, there would 
  NEVER be enough to go around. So, we were left to entertain ourselves. And for 
  a while, I did. Travelling with Morwin, Malekith, Elendar, and Kephrin, I've 
  had more fun than I've had playing any sort of networked game. It went away 
  though. Now the UO team seems to be focusing on 'player run towns', 'player 
  run taverns', etc. I don't mean to bash these things because the people who 
  run them should be congratulated for putting in the time and the effort. 
  However, this is not why I got into UO. To me, this is pushing UO to be 
  nothing but a glorified chat room where you can sit around with 20 other 
  people, waiting for the orcs in the orc camp to respawn. I was expecting so 
  much more. However, after talking with my roommate (Morwin) and my friend Tom 
  (Malekith), I've come to the conclusion that UO will never be the game I've 
  dreamt of. There is an inherent design flaw. When I play Ultima, my travelling 
  companions and I are the heroes. In UO there is no way for everyone to be the 
  hero. There can't be. This isn't meant as some power trip or anything like 
  that. Look at it this way, in Ultima, when you enter a dungeon, its you vs. 
  the dungeon. In Ultima Online, there are way too many groups in the dungeon, 
  to the point where three guys are ganging up on one monster. Add this in with 
  the fact that there really is no point. In Ultima, you go into the dungeon to 
  get some item to help you solve your quest. In UO, you go into the dungeon to 
  'kill monsters' and 'get their stuff'. This is fun for a while, but it gets 
  old. In any case, I'm finished. I'll be looking forward to Baulder's Gate and 
  Diablo II, so I may travel with the many friends I made in UO, however I will 
  be steering clear of large scale games such as UO and Everquest. I don't mean 
  to bash these games, I'm just saying they aren't for me anymore. I welcome any 
  comments, however readers are warned that I do no plan on updating these pages 
  anymore. Good bye and thanks to everyone I have encountered online who made my 
  playing UO an enjoyable and memorable experience. 
  <LI>(7/31/98) - Well, I have to admit, UO is finally losing its pull. I 
  haven't been on in a while. All the other cavaliers seem to be holding the 
  same opinion. We may try one last thing, however. We might try running a 
  'Newbie Quest'. Since NONE of us have ever been involved in any Origin event, 
  the game is getting pretty bland for us. Going around and killing monsters 
  loses my interest pretty quickly nowadays. So, my two choice are PKing (which 
  I will never do) and this. We have to come up with a good idea for a quest, as 
  well as having newbies who wish to actually run through it. It should be fun 
  (I won't do it unless we get a good idea.....) Anyone who wishes to take part 
  (either in running the quest or taking part in the quest) should email me, 
  post on the cavalier's message board, or ICQ me at 8465082. The idea is that 
  the newbies would start with brand new characters, and be lead through a 
  series of events and trials which hopefully should get them well started into 
  the game (as well as keep everyone entertained). 
  <LI>(7/19/98) - I have a new fan. I got the following email today: "i am 14 
  and i think all you adults who play the game are losers, i mean dont you have 
  jobs, games are for children and teens get a life please" It gave me a good 
  chuckle, so I just had to share! 
  <LI>(6/29/98) - Well, I passed my oral exam! I can play UO again! Feel's like 
  I've been away forever. I'll be paying a little more attention to this page. 
  I'm looking at reorganizing it as well. We are also looking at updating the 
  Cavalier's web page, making it a bit more snazzy. A few of us are also looking 
  into starting up the newbie classes again. Maybe even adding some elements to 
  make them a bit more interesting. More to come, stay tuned! 
  <LI>(5/18/98) - BTW - I put up a message board for the <A 
  href="http://www.glue.umd.edu/~docmani/dsbc/">Skara Brae Cavaliers</A>. If you 
  have any UO experiences or questions, I would refer people to the new <A 
  href="http://www.glue.umd.edu/~docmani/dsbc/wwwboard">message board.</A> There 
  should be a few people there that can help you. 
  <LI>(5/14/98) - Not UO related, but for anyone that pops by this web site 
  regularly (there are people that do that????), its going to show a significant 
  lack of updates probably until the end of June. For those that don't know, I 
  am a PhD student and I will be studying for my PhD oral exam over the next 
  month or so. When I come back, I should have more time to start up UO newbie 
  classes again. We'll see. 
  <LI>(5/7/98) - I read <A href="http://update.owo.com/devcomm.shtml">Designer 
  Dragon's recent philosophical thoughts on UO</A> today. I read it twice just 
  so I could pick up on what he was trying to say. Now, let me state my opinion 
  of it (as I often tend to do on this page :). I think 90% of it is crap. I 
  don't mean to knock the roleplaying towns such as Oasis, who have done a 
  spectacular job against the odds. However, I think DD is copping out by 
  attributing the success of Oasis to the design of UO. Please. Oasis is where 
  it is now because of the hard work of the players who have been FIGHTING the 
  design of UO, tooth and nail. In his own design document, he talks about 
  rewarding players for 'good' actions through game mechanics. Right now, its 
  more advantageous on a personal level to be evil! Most of the castles I've 
  seen are owned by PKers. I know this because they like to come out and chase 
  me when they see me walk by. What DD has totally forgotten about is the new 
  players and the players who like to run around in small groups. I agree, this 
  is a social game. Running around by myself is boring. However, I have no 
  interest in creating a town. Its not that I have anything against these player 
  built towns. Quite the contrary, I have a great amount of respect for them and 
  the people that run them. However, thats not me. Its not my character. I've 
  always been self reliant. I like traveling with my group of friends. I like 
  meeting and helping people. But, I have no desire to build or help to build a 
  town. I play a different role. I help to save newbies from the game. Its hard 
  for new players to start. Much harder than when I started. Between PKers, 
  tough monsters, and an economy that works against new players with low skill, 
  its tough to start out without help or advice. I help because the game is 
  inherently unfair to new players in its current form. Someone has to. I don't 
  do this because of the way DD designed the game. The people who have strived 
  to build Oasis didn't do it because this is the way DD designed the game. We 
  did it because its who we are. I'm not asking to be rewarded for this, don't 
  get me wrong. All I've ever asked for is a level playing field. Right now, the 
  game in its current for rewards the evil player. Hopefully, the new reputation 
  system will affect this, however I believe DD is implying that nothing is 
  wrong with the game, and to that, I disagree. 
  <LI>(4/22/98) - Ouch! Monsters have gotten tougher. You figure a master 
  swordsman/GM warrior wouldn't have problems killing a few harpies. Go figure. 
  The new poison stuff is really annoying. Its not bad enough that you have to 
  cast cure on yourself every 5 minutes in covetous, but all the poison spamming 
  is really annoying. Just thought I'd throw a word out. Be careful out there! 
  They really need to rethink this poison stuff. You can spend a huge amount of 
  resources just fighting slimes and snakes, and not get anything for your 
  trouble. Where is the motivation to fight? On another note: Jet Black Dyed 
  clothes. What is up with this? I've seen people running around in these really 
  awful looking black clothes. People selling black dye tubs at 400 gp a piece 
  (which is really funny considering how easy it is to make them)! UO's first 
  fashion craze! Get a grip people!!! Anyways, I don't care if people want to 
  run around looking unoriginal (since thats all these people are), but I don't 
  like the fact that people are selling these dye tubs for so much cash to 
  unsuspecting characters. If you REALLY feel you need black clothes, download 
  the <A href="http://www.glue.umd.edu/~docmani/frun14.zip">hack</A> and do it 
  yourself, don't waste your money. I am only posting this hack because the 
  6000% profit people are making off of selling these dye tubs is revolting. 
  With the hack, you only need one ordinary dye tub and one set of ordinary 
  dyes. I've tested it and it works. BACKUP YOUR LOGIN.CFG FILE BEFORE USING. 
  I'm not responsible for anyone who blows up their client in the process of 
  doing this. I'd advise against using this hack though. There are SOOOOOOOOOO 
  many people running around with this black clothes on and they look SOOOOO 
  stupid. I tried it, I put on my black cape and black robe, and promptly took 
  it off. I'd much rather not look like everyone else. And as for the guilds 
  that 'require' these clothes, give me a break. Be original okay? 
  <LI>(4/21/98) - We an interesting tidbit popped up on <A 
  href="http://www.uovault.com/">http://www.uovault.com/</A> that is noteworthy. 
  Some guy (Kurtz) claims he caught a regular player (Neil Diamond) using GM 
  powers (an off duty GM possibly abusing his GM privs...) There is a log and 
  some screen shots there that I'm not going to bother reposting. If true, its 
  pretty annoying. The idea that this guy was running around PKing and seemed to 
  have an extremely high spell resistance, as well as GM mage level (very 
  difficult, but possible to do legitimately) is shocking. He was supposedly 
  caught with his invunerable flag on for a brief second, seen walking through 
  walls, and was able to 'kick' the guy who caught him off UO. I was skeptical, 
  until this guy's friend Jyrath made a few posts. You see, the most annoying 
  thing to me, is this guy Jyrath seems to have a nice little house with a 
  forge. This stock house in UO currently CANNOT have a forge which means it had 
  to have been placed there by a GM. It is true that other such houses exist, 
  however this is the first privately owned (non-public) house that I've heard 
  of. Jyrath has been accused of cheating, alot of people are pissed at him, so 
  he has posted publicly a few times. Most of these posts seem to confirm: 1) A 
  GM helped to furnish his house and 2) His buddy did accidentally have his 
  invunerable flag on and 3) His buddy did in fact kick the accuser off UO by 
  using his GM powers. He does claim the log posted is doctored though. He 
  claims the accuser was spamming and yelling which is why he was kicked. I can 
  believe that. If I had caught these guys, I'd have a few choice words for 
  them, myself! This isn't the first instance of GM abuse, but it seems to be 
  the most publicized case of it. Let this be a lesson, keep your screen cap 
  utilities up, otherwise nobody will believe you. As it is, there are a good 
  number of people calling these fake. I wasn't sure before, but after reading 
  Jyrath's posts, I'm leaning towards believing the accuser. 
  <LI>(4/20/98) - I really haven't updated this in a while! This isn't really a 
  news item, just something I found was entertaining. I was on this past 
  weekend, goofing around with one of the cavaliers. Took on a lich, got killed. 
  My heart almost stopped when I realized the newbie hanging out by my corpse 
  DIDN'T LOOT IT! I ressed, got my stuff back, finished off the Lich. We then 
  took our new friend to the bank and helped him out with some shinny new 
  equipment. I figure this behavior is rare and should be rewarded. :) 
  Meanwhile, at this bank, I was sitting there waiting for a friend to come 
  back. This 'blue' guy named Cromwell was running around snooping peoples 
  packs. He stayed blue because he never stole items. He was just trying to goad 
  people into attacking him (this is the new thief trick. You can attack those 
  who steal from you, but not those who snoop). However this trick is easily 
  countered by simply calling the guards and having them kill the guy for you. 
  So, he starts looking at my new friend and all the items I just gave him, 
  listing each one out aloud. I told this genetic defect that he was just being 
  annoying and he should go away. Of course, he starts swearing at me. Morwin 
  got in a few slicing blows, which were obviously too advanced for this guy to 
  even understand. However, we agreed, I had the retort of the day. We had just 
  called the guards on this guy, he ressed and says, "**** you. I'm just making 
  a living. We thieves need lives too you know." To which I replied, "I agree 
  completely. You are in desparate need of a life." I mean, if you're going to 
  bother getting into a name calling battle with me, please don't leave me such 
  an open shot! :) 
  <LI>(3/25/98) - OOps. Haven't updated this in a while. The plan for recall to 
  consume a rune has been put on hold because of the player outcry. They are 
  looking for alternatives at this point. On another note, I just wanted to say 
  that I have had a change of heart in how I play this game. Its been a while in 
  coming. (Rant mode on) Last night, a friend of mine were wandering along. We 
  happen upon this Great Lord who was fighting an ettin. We asked if he needed 
  help. He said, "Not really, but you can help anyways". So, we just gave him a 
  little fire support. I threw a few spells and RA'd the guy. Morwin (my friend) 
  shot some arrows. Just as the ettin was about to die, he leaves combat mode 
  and says, "Your kill". Morwin took him down. As Morwin has yet to reach 
  'Honorable' level, this was a nice thing for the guy to do. He then says, "The 
  loot is yours, have fun guys" I though, finally, a nice guy. Good to see. 
  Meanwhile, there was this 'dishonorable' guy hanging about. He swipes all the 
  stuff off the ettin corpse and runs. I tracked him, and saw him standing near 
  a group of people who were preoccupied in a coversation (this guy looked like 
  he was about to start picking pockets, but I didn't see him actually do this) 
  So, I do what I always do. I gave the guy a chance to live by simply asking 
  for the items back. He did what they always do. He ran. Tracked him all the 
  way across the forest near Yew. And what did he do? He ran through a moongate 
  and got away scot free. We were pissed. I must now do something I never 
  thought I would. In cases such as this, I'm going to attack first and ask 
  questions later. I still give greys and reds the benefit of the doubt. About 
  10 minutes after that, I helped a grey who was having quite a bit of trouble 
  with a cow. I healed him, knocked the cow down to 1/4 of its hits, and left. 
  However, if I have been wronged, or my compatriots have been wronged.... No 
  warnings. No mercy. 
  <LI>(3/12/98) - Recall is about to be crippled! The comming soon section 
  states that recall and gate travel will CONSUME THE RUNE when cast. That means 
  we will be forced to walk through unpopulated wilderness to get anywhere. 
  Player killers are going to have a field day with this! They don't venture 
  deep into the dungeons for fear that they could get double teamed by both 
  players and monsters. In the wilderness, they won't have any fear of this. 
  You'll see ambushes everywhere. If you feel this is a bad idea, EMAIL OSI! In 
  my opinion, this is just a really bad idea. They are forcing this on us 
  because nobody is wandering through the wilderness. If they reduced the lag in 
  the wilderness and added some creatures, maybe people wouldn't use recall so 
  much! They should fix the problems in the game rather than punishing the 
  players. 
  <LI>(3/11/98) - More on the lawsuit. <A 
  href="http://www.pcgamer.com/features/uolawsuit-01.html">PC Gamer</A> has 
  their own article on the lawsuit. It really opens ones eyes about the level of 
  greed people have. Most likely, this case will be settled out of court. We, 
  the players of UO, will most likely get some token offering, and this lawyer, 
  who is supposedly fighting for our rights, gets a big fat check. Will it solve 
  lag? Will it have any effect? Origin will probably end up redoing the box to 
  address the claims in the lawsuit. In other words, nothing substantial. The 
  only winner in this will be the lawyer. Apparently, he's set up a web page at 
  <A 
  href="http://www.isomedia.com/home/uopleadings/">http://www.isomedia.com/home/uopleadings/</A>. 
  However, when I go to that site, nothing comes up but a blank background. If 
  you view the HTML source, there is something there (nothing substantial). The 
  guy can't even make decent HTML.... 
  <LI>(3/10/98) - Its official. I guess it had to happen sooner or later. A 
  group of people have filed a class action lawsuit against Origin Systems. An 
  article about this can be found <A 
  href="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_03/09_uo/index.html">here</A>. In 
  my opinion, its totally bogus and they shouldn't have ground to stand on. 
  However, it seems that class action lawsuit by AOL users was on similar 
  grounds and that one DID manage to succeed. Is this the begining of the end 
  for UO? Stay tuned. I'll be following this and posting any official 
  information here. There are lots of rumors floating around. This article and a 
  post by Designer Dragon saying he is not allowed to comment on pending 
  litigation are the only official pieces of news. The rumor that OSI is going 
  to hold off implementing bug fixes is JUST A RUMOR. The only thing that may 
  happen is DD and others from the design team may be forbidden from posting on 
  the various chat boards around, while the lawsuit is going on. 
  <LI>(3/3/98) - Blue PKs seem to be everyone. These are guys who circumvent the 
  current noteriety system to kill and loot players. Their favorite technique 
  seems to be using blade spirits and trapping you in a corner (use of blade 
  spirits does not affect their noteriety). I've also seen a couple blues cast 
  summon demon and transfer control of the demon to a red. Be warned. I have 
  seen more blue PKs than red PKs in the past week alone. Its is only going to 
  get worse, until the new noteriety system goes into place. As soon as any of 
  these guys loots a corpse they are fair game, in the new system. Until then, 
  watch your back. Another thing to watch for now is thieves working in groups. 
  My friend had some items stolen from him last night. He was hidden. The game 
  did not tell him that he had been detected, either. The guy stole an item from 
  him, and handed it to his buddy before we had a chance to call the guards. Why 
  do people need to use these loopholes? Why can't they just play the game as it 
  was meant to be played? </LI></UL><A

<H3>My Plans for UO</H3>My friends and I are brewing up some plans. We're 
working on a web page. <A href="http://www.glue.umd.edu/~docmani/dsbc">Take a 
minute and visit it.</A> I'll be updating these pages fairly frequently once my 
fellow cavaliers have signed on to the game! I'm currently toying with the idea 
of putting together <A href="http://www.glue.umd.edu/~docmani/uo/join.html">an 
adventuring party</A> on the Chesapeake shard, for anyone interested. I'll still 
be putting up journals every so often, highlighting interesting events, however 
since anyone can now play UO, I really won't be doing a daily journal. 
<H3>For more fun, go see the Official Ultima Online Web Site</H3>This includes 
all sorts of information about Ultima Online. Skills, spells, weapons, and all 
sorts of other fun. <A href="http://www.owo.com/">Take a look!</A> 
<H3>Some Thoughts on UO currently</H3>UO is finally at the point where it is 
tough! I mean really tough. However, I'm concerned that newbies are going to 
have problems starting out. My only advice at this point is FIND FRIENDS. A 
newbie cannot go out adventuring alone. I'm an adept swordsman (84 Sword/50 
Tactics) and I'm getting ROCKED by monsters when I'm by myself. Be careful out 
there. You might want to save up some money have find some of the player run 
magic item shops.
