<H2>Catalog of our Journeys</H2>
<P>This all started on the 8th of April, when I met Lord British online.</P>
<P>April 8: A group of us headed off to seek adventure. After touring the map, 
we decided to confront the Orc menace directly a large group of us, lead by Lord 
British himself, staged an all out assult on the Orc stronghold to the south. 
After a large battle we managed to take the city. But we found something we did 
not expect. A gold knight appeared to be in the city. After our King had 
defeated this most powerful foe, we discovered a key. But what did this key 
unlock? He told us that the answer lie in the crypts. We entered the cemetary, 
but this time at great cost. By the time we had reached the crypts some of our 
comrades had fallen. By the time we reached the door at marked the beginning of 
our quest, all but our Lord had perished. Separated from my King and with our 
quest unfinished, I vowed to fight on. But alas, I was alone and injured. I 
shall rest, and practice my skills. Then I shall assemble a group to finish this 
quest. The quest to the Orc Tower!</P>
<P>April 9: I met my friends, Powerslave and Dagon. We decided to group up so we 
could better confront the orcs. Upon arriving at one of the Orc camps, we 
encountered another traveler, Hawk, who also joined our party. After much 
fighting, we became fairly good at fighting the orcs. Another traveller came 
along, named Shadow, and also asked to join our party. He told us of more Orcs 
to the south, most likely near the large Orc encampment. We decided to go, 
feeling that we could handle any suprises. We were wrong. The first wave came, 
and we handled it pretty well. But soon the second wave followed with an Orc 
captain leading the charge. Our party, as well as another at the site, were 
routed. I noticed that 5 Orcs and the captain were intent on killing Hawk. I 
knew there was little I could do against that captain, but I had to try. I ran 
behind him and took a swipe at him with my axe. Enraged, he turned. I had 
distracted him from Hawk. However, the angered Orc hit me and hit me hard. There 
was no way I could fight this beast so I fled, our party was splintered by the 
Orc onslaught. Fortunately, I got away with a whole skin. I soon found Pow and 
Dag, but no sign of Shadow or Hawk. After healing and dealing with a few more 
Orcs, we decided to go into town to look for our lost comrades. We split up. The 
two went into town to buy supplies. I went west, back to the Orc camp to look 
for my comrades. Thats when I started to notice something strange. I had avoided 
a very large number of Orc captains on my journey. I talked to other travellers 
who noticed the same. That number of captains could only mean a large army was 
nearby. Worried at this prospect, I decided that I should check the town to see 
what others had discovered. When I returned, the orcs were upon us. They kept 
coming and coming. I help to defend the main bridge into town. Some orcs had 
made it fairly deep into the city. A group of us held the bridge. Held it, that 
is, until the captains came. The beasts had downed two unfortunate warriors and 
had routed the rest. The rest waited on the bridge, prepared to run. None of us 
could fight these beasts. Only the town guards were capable of this, but none 
were to be seen. I decided something needed to be done. Again, I ran forward and 
took a taunting swipe at one of the creatures. Angered, he began to chase me 
into the city. I stayed away from the city center and ran until I found a guard 
and alerted him to the problem. He dispatched the captain within minutes. It was 
at this point that Pow and Dag had returned from getting supplies. We needed to 
defend the city, so we returned to the fray. Again, we dove into battle. Again, 
the captains came and routed us. This time, however, I was not so fortunate. 
Wounded by Orcs, an Orc captain struck the final blow. I returned to the Ahnk, 
my trademark crimson armor gone. Separated again from my comrades, I decided to 
pass the battle at the main gate and do reconissance to the north. As I had 
feared, the Orc armies were everywhere in large numbers. A group of 
inexperienced fighters were wholed up inside a shack, fending off the armies. 
Fortunately for them, a mage with a wand of fireballs arrived and evened the 
odds. With this done, I returned to the city. I found Pow, but Dagon was nowhere 
to be found. The Orc attack was subsiding. The city was saved. We decided that 
we needed more experience to fight, for the Orcs would return one day. We 
returned to the wilderness to fight the remaining rouge Orcs, and ended a 
moderately successful day.</P>
<P>I will say this of my comrades. They are honorable and good fighters. I know 
I will be able to count on them when we finally assult the Orc tower.</P>
<P>April 10: Pow, Dag and I joined up and set off again. After doing some 
fighting in the Graveyard, we encountered Lothar, one of the people who had 
travelled with Lord British. Lothar had been on the quest and had a fireball 
wand. I asked if he would take us on the quest. He said he would do so, if we 
joined his new mercenary group, the BlackWatch. We agreed. The BlackWatch is 
truly forming into an Army. However, this army seemed more concerned with the 
Orc encampments than on reaching the tower. They're quest was not mine. Pow and 
Dag decided to remain with BlackWatch. I bid them farewell and I wish them well. 
I was never meant to be part of an army. So, I wandered the countryside by 
myself, taking on whatever creatures approached. I grew weary of this, I needed 
companionship again. The company of others is important on a long quest such as 
this. It was at this point I happened upon Axa and Weinhard, in the cemetary. We 
banded together for mutual protection. After a short stay in the graveyard, I 
decided to play my favorite game: Knight Tag. Weinhard joined me. This game 
involves finding one of the magical knights near the graveyard and enticing them 
to follow you into the city, so the guards kill them. Its a nice way to get an 
attractive suit of armor. However, a guard did not kill the knight this time. My 
old friend, Tasslehoff, did. He too traveled with Lord British and he too 
possessed a fireball wand. After a short discussion, Tas suggested he might lead 
me through the quest tomorrow night. We shall see. I bid him fairwell. At this 
point, Weinhard also took his leave of me. I was alone again. I went back to the 
cemetary and happened upon a woman with a sword, but no armor. Seeing her wander 
into the cemetary, I realized she knew not of its danger. I offered myself as a 
guide. So, I spent the rest of my evening showing Lyta the perils of this world. 
When I left her, we were both stronger. I then went to rest. It was a long 
night. Tomorrow, I shall enter the quest. Do or die.</P>
<P>April 11: Oh boy! What a night! I met up with Dag, Hawk, and Ozone. We 
decided tonight was the night. We would complete the quest or die trying. The 
first step was to find a gold knight and get the key we needed to go on the 
quest. We therefore made an assult on the orc camp. Fortunately for us, Ozone 
had a friend who go us the key. We were a relatively weak to face the perils in 
the quest, but we decided to go anyways. Our determination would protect us for 
harm. Again, we had more good fortune and encountered a mage named Zexor. He 
offered his services as a guide through the quest. He was very powerful and 
possessed one of the mystical fireball wands. We joined a fellow named Sir Loin, 
as well and made our way into the crypt. After facing many skeletons, we pulled 
the magic lever that was to lead us into our quest. We went through a series of 
teleports and arrived at the Orc Tower. The perils were many. Orc Captains and 
Knights were everywhere. We entered the tower, which appear to be a giant 
puzzle. Pulling the correct levers would spur you forward. Pulling the wrong 
levers would push you back. With Zexor's help we managed to make it fairly deep 
into the tower. Unfortunately, I mistook an instruction and was teleported away 
from my comrades back to the entrance of the tower! I was alone and vunerable. 
Deperately, I tried to remember the instructions Zexor had shown us. I made my 
way back the spot where I had disappeared, but my companions were gone. Alone 
and confused, I was forced to make my own way, hoping that Zexor had cleared the 
path of any powerful creatures. By trial and error, I managed to go further on. 
However one obstacle stood in my way, an Orc Captain! At this point, I had never 
fought one and lived. Fortunately my prowess in magic had become great and I 
dispatched the beast with due haste! After solving the labyrinth of magical 
levers, I managed to make it to the top of the tower and rejoin my companions. 
But, alas, all I found were Dagon and Zexor. All the rest of my group had 
fallen. Suddenly a mage appeared out of nowhere. The mage also carried one of 
the mystical wands. After a mighty battle, Zexor defeated the evil mage. Dagon 
took the wand. After a short while, another mage appeared and Zexor displayed 
the same prowess in defeating him. This time, I took the wand. Our quest 
complete Dagon and I exited the tower and were returned to the cemetary, after 
thanking Zexor for his generous help. Dagon and I parted company. We could do 
more damage seperatly. I then sought some of my former companions. I found Lyta 
and Hylow soon after. I was eager to test the power of my new weapon. And power 
it was. I was able to destroy any enemy before me with little to no effort. Lyta 
even complained that my enthusiasm with my new weapon was preventing my fellows 
from partaking in any combat! They were getting bored! So, I exercised some 
restraint and only attacked when needed. We journeyed for quite some time, 
clearing the land of foul orcs. Hylow expressed intrest in seeing the orc tower, 
as did Lyta. So, we set out to find another Gold Knight, and another key. After 
a fierce battle at the Orc city, Hylow managed to secure one of the gold keys. 
We returned to the orc tower, only to find dangerous people inside. People also 
on the quest, but intent on destroying me and my fellows. We did not finish the 
quest and we left the orc tower to rest. At this point, I felt my time on this 
world drawing to an end. Lyta and Hylow would go on, but this was my end. I had 
accomplished all I had set out to do. I had quested, obtained the wand, helped 
my fellows and helped to rid the land of the orc menace. But, I had one last 
decision to make. A powerful weapon, such as the fireball wand, must be passed 
on. Its power is great, but only in the hands of someone who would use it as I 
had, for the good of all. Lyta and Hylow were both excellent choices, but alas, 
I had only one wand. I bestowed the wand to Lyta, as she was of lower level and 
needed the extra advantage. But a condition was placed on this. She was to help 
Hylow obtain another wand from the orc tower. I can only hope they will be 
successful and continue on in helping the land. I know the world is in good 
hands with the companions I have travelled with this past week. I thank everyone 
for their help and their companionship. They made my stay in this world most 
enjoyable. Thanks to all of you.</P>
