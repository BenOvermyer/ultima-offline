<h1 align=center><em><strong><u>The Search for a New Home Ends ...</u></strong></em></h1>
<h1 align=center>&nbsp; </h1>
<p align=left>Distressed at seeing the deteriorating condition of Yserbius, and not quite content with the Realm, it 
became very clear to me that my search for a new home was not over yet. This feeling came to me 
only when I saw The Realm of Britannia, or Ultima Online. At first, I only saw the application form. 
After overcoming from joyful hysterics, I managed to fill out the form. Days later, the form 
dissappeared, and I later found out that I was extremely lucky to have been there when I was. :) 
The first pre-alpha test was a complete fiasco for me, since I realized that I needed a local internet 
provider with SLIP/PPP access, though I learned about the huge, expanding world of the internet 
little by little. After I finally found a competant net provider in my neighborhood, I started my 
journies in Britian, Britannia's capital city. It was rather difficult for me at first, since I was grossly 
inexperienced compared to the other players, and I wasn't online as often as most. By the time the 
test was finished, I ascended to the paltry level of 2. I was also killed during the anarchy of the final 
day, where many areas were in flames, and was unable to hook back up for the speech by Lord 
British. </p>
<p>Luckily, for me, the wonderful folk at Origin wanted us to test UO once again, and I was as 
ecstatic as the last time. With more experience, and more time on my hands, I managed to ascend 
to the 20's of levels; not the highest when you see the competition, though I was a decently skilled 
player, and I'm proud to say that I only died twice during this test; once was a suicide via the &quot;Por 
Flam&quot; spell when I was stuck in a tree and unable to move to a Z-coordinate error, and another 
time when high ranking officers of the High Mages of Britannia were taking me through the orc 
camp, and couldn't bring themselves to slay the orc lord that was lurking toward me (well, such 
ineptitude shall soon be forgotten ... considering that the HMB disbanded, hehe). As the first test, 
my beginnings were humble. I slew many rabbits the first day, my favorite battle-cry being, 
&quot;Vultures will pick at thy floppy ears!&quot; Well, I tried to make a funny, and who knows, maybe the 
others laughed inside, but it became clear to me that most of the players didn't appreciate that kind 
of humor, or the olde language either, which was fine by me, since I thought that it was grossly 
unncessary, deep down. One day, I was levelling in the southern wood of Britian, and met a guy 
named <strong>Gramayre</strong>, who really should have been named <strong>Laa'vaal</strong>, but this is an entirely different 
story. We talked for a bit, and even parted after a minute or so of fighting, but we found that we 
were running into each other more and more often. We joined up, and we soon found that we were 
an almost invincible fighting team. Before long, we advanced to orcs, and soon we were hacking at 
skeletons in the graveyard. First, I could only take out one skeleton before being hurt so bad that I 
was forced to retreat. This soon changed. Soon, I was able to go deep inside the graveyard, even 
its underground tunnels, and soon I found myself escorting some real simpactico newbies and even 
managed to get them out of there alive. Actually, only one died, but I got his stuff for him, and 
everything was cool. His name was <strong>Arthur</strong>, AKA &quot;<strong>Techmage Dragon</strong>&quot;. Despite our huge gap in 
levels, and the fact that I had to monitor his life bar whenever we were in some seedy territory, we 
got along very well, and despite his level, he managed to harass a few skeletons, and did it well. 
We later caught wind of news of a tournament to be held at Lord British's castle, and we thought, 
cool, even if we weren't strong enough to take some of the most notoriously powerful characters 
there, it would be quite an amazing show. Even the pre-tournament gathering was filled with great 
chaos. Origin apparently thought that it would be funny to unleash about 20 or so Orc Lords at us, 
and too be honest, I thought so too! Especially since my friend suggested that we go up to the 
balcony and watch the crowd from above ...</p>
<p align=center><img src="../ethereal_void/screen_missing.jpg" align=bottom width=150 height=150> </p>
<p align=left><font size=3>The Tournament began after only a few minutes of the invasion. The mob scene in the courtyard 
made it difficult to walk around, so again, I found someplace up high, and watched some of my 
many aquaintances kick ass. ;) The next day, was the final day of Ultima Online pre-alpha testing. It 
felt strange, like the day that your vacation was finally over, and it was time to pack up, and go to 
the airport for the boring journey back home. For the hell of it, I decided to get my levels up in the 
ole graveyard. To my joy, I met Laa'vaal again, and together we fought literally <strong>rows</strong> of skeletons, 
at least 8 a spawn (roughly a minute, give or take a few seconds), and they were spawning fast. 
After our levels were fairly decent, we agreed to check out the &quot;godlands&quot;, where we could find fire 
maces and multicolored armor. While green is my preferred color in all these games, to have white 
armor would show great status, so we knew we wanted the armor bad, so we tried to find this 
&quot;gap&quot; in the northwest fence (I'm not even sure if they had white armor out there, though it was still 
a dream of mine :p). We felt the place of dreams coming closer and closer, as if it were some weird 
link to the Force or something, but our dreams were severed as literally a <strong>dozen</strong> Orc Lords were 
tailing us. Not wanting to get killed by these huge, drooling things, we split up, and ran off in 
different directions, without as much as a word to each other. I ran for almost ten minutes ... as 5 of 
'em were chasing me and closing in. As one would get bored and leave, another would take its 
place. By the time I reached these farms, they were almost all gone, but I saw some of em in the 
distance, but luckily they didn't follow. I was relieved to find the bridge linking the wilderness to 
Britian, though I saw <strong>more</strong> Orc Lords spawning nearby, and someone kept casting &quot;Quas An Lor&quot; 
(darkness) on the bridge, and I barely made it through the crowd of people and orcs to the other 
side. I was then surprised to find a green knight <strong>inside</strong> the town, which was usually an unlikely 
sight, but since the test was about to end, I suppose Origin wanted to see what we'd do. I'll admit 
that I had a lot of fun that day. Anyway, I took out the green knight easily, though they're the 
weakest enemy knights in the game so far, which was a stroke of luck for me, since green is my 
color. It was still a great victory for me, since my first suit of green armor was given to me ... one 
day I was in the wilderness, in search of a green knight, and I met another character who killed one 
swiftly. The guy then asked me, &quot;Do you want the armor?&quot; or something to that affect, and I'm like 
&quot;Sure! Thanks!&quot;, and &quot;Thank the F***heads!&quot; (censored for the younger audiences and those who 
are easily offended :) ) was his reply. It was actually a guild that I heard about on the chat zone, and 
I was scared of it at first, since I thought that they were evil marauders (the name, after all), but 
nothing can be further from the truth. You see, I am bored of these guilds where they seem 
compelled to say &quot;Thou art&quot; and so on, and try to put themselves into some popsicle tree 
storybook, so I really tried avoiding these guilds like the plague (I'm proud to say that the guilds 
that I was ever affiliated with were never like this, and were a lot of fun). I've seen the F***heads 
before, and thought that they were real cool to hang out with. I never met a group that swore so 
much without restraint, and some people seem to have a problem with that ... oh well, to each his 
own. Their laid back look at life, in addition to their good hearts, was a breath of fresh air. Besides, 
you play these games to have fun, right? To escape the stress of real life. Eventually, I met with this 
group again, but I shall leave this story for later :) .</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>Three Orc Lords tailed me all the way to the gates of Lord British's castle, and luckily, some high 
level friends that I knew took em out quite well. :) There was a crowd of people, getting real bored, 
waiting for some action. Well, they got their wish. First, some notorious Player Killer comes out of 
nowhere, I can't remember whether it was Lenny or Lolita, but we went after both of them that 
day. While some of the more successful knights went after their stat-editing hides, I cast heal spells 
my friends who were after the Pkillers, and even got in a few good hits on 'em myself. 
Unfortunately, I lost the lynch mob due to heavy lag, but I instantly found action at the temple. 
Apparently, some jerkboy PKiller was after my friend Arthur, he seemed to be at a lower level 
than me, since he wasn't wearing colored armor, but he wasn't listening to anyone, so I whacked 
him swiftly with my great axe. The end of the test 30 minutes away, I decided to move back to the 
castle, in case something interesting happened. Sure enough, they told us that Lord British would 
give another speech. I was overjoyed, since I missed the last one. I also met<strong> </strong>Laa'vaal again, and 
we grabbed some spots by the building where the speech would be given, and watched ...</font></p>
<p align=center><font size=3><img src="../ethereal_void/screen_missing.jpg" align=bottom width=150 height=150> </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>The initial chaos which was bound to take place, came, and nobody was disappointed, I guess. ;) 
As the Lord British look-a-like walked forth ... we were suddenly faced with a whole bunch of Orc 
Lords, I was almost getting tired of looking at them, their initial &quot;shock affect&quot; had long worn off on 
me.</font></p>
<p align=center><img src="../ethereal_void/screen_missing.jpg" align=bottom width=150 height=150> </p>
<p align=left><font size=3>I'm the green guy, topmost, and Laa'vaal's right next to me, fighting some massive Orc Lord. In the 
meantime, I couldn't help him, since I was cornered. The orc ultimately killed him, as he screamed 
his final goodbye. Death wasn't important at the time, since we were going to be permenantly 
disconnected at any moment, so I just saw this as a chance to avenge my friend and take out all 
that pent up agression on some weird AI thing. ;) Finally, the orc died, and I knew that we were 
together victorious. The moment was short-lived, as the server was finally shut down. </font></p>
<p align=center><img src="../ethereal_void/screen_missing.jpg" align=bottom width=150 height=150> </p>
<p align=left><font size=3>The end? Nope. :) I travelled to Atlanta, Georgia to see <strong>Dragon*Con</strong>, initially to see some Star 
Wars celebrities, but when I found out that Richard Garriot would be there, I now had two reasons 
to go. :) Unfortunately, I arrived late, and was unable to meet Brewmeister and Ruziska as planned, 
though I met Brewmeister, as well as Riva Dragon, during an appearance made by Garriot in the 
Origin Room. We heard much about Ultima IX, Ultima Online, and we even got to play UO again, 
and I had almost forgotten how much I was addicted to it. During a lunch sponsored by Origin for 
members of the Ultima Dragons, we told many stories about what we did during pre-alpha, and of 
course I had to bore Garriot which my story about how I had to Por Flam myself just to get out of 
a tree. Riva was talking about how a whole bunch of his friends killed all the NPC's in Lord 
British's castle and took it for themselves, and I was thinking, &quot;That's pretty cool ... who would 
actually do something like that?&quot; I wasn't too familiar with the guilds of everyone, so I asked him 
what guild he was in, and not to my surprise, it was the F***heads. By mid-late summer, it was 
clear that none of the guilds which I was affiliated with wanted to move or set up a chapter in 
Ultima Online, so I knew that I'd be guildless there ... I knew that I liked what the F***heads were 
up to; how they defended the underdog from PKillers, their defience against evil, their benevolence, 
and most of all, their free-spiritedness, so I joined them. I, with my bretheren, cannot wait for the 
upcoming beta test. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>Of course, all good things must come to an end ... 
  and after countless battles and adventures, the guildmaster Reverend Brucifer 
  reformed his guild, and all members were thrown out, and some choice members 
  who held his every opinion to be true were readmitted. My brother-in-cyberspace 
  Mocker objected to this, and I objected as well, as many a friend of mine were 
  no longer welcome. Thus my adventures in Britannia have drawn to a close. May 
  we soon find a new land to explore.</font><EMBED SRC="theme.html" width="5" height="1" AUTOSTART="true" LOOP="true"></p>
