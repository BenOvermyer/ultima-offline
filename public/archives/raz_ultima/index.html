      Ultima Online from the 1996 owo.com: <BR><BR>"Ultima Online is a 
      multi-player role-playing game designed for real-time adventuring over the 
      Internet. Eventually, thousands of people will be able to access this 
      fantastic world around the clock and interact simultaneously with each 
      other and the entire world. Set in the Ultima universe, Ultima Online 
      enables players to adventure in a truly ongoing world. A world where 
      battles are fought with might and mind, alliances are formed and 
      shattered, and both enemies and friends are just as interested in wealth 
      and power as you are. Slay a dragon, form a government, join a guild, 
      craft and sell wares, and meet your friends at the tavern, all while 
      playing Ultima Online." -ORIGIN <BR><BR><FONT color=#a51800

      align=left></A> The first map is from the 1996 owo.com website, it is the 
      original concept OSI had for Ultima Online. The world or shards would 
      consist of four continents. The first continent is obviously Sosaria or 
      the Lands of Lord British commonly known as Britannia. The second 
      continent is the Lands of the Feudal Lords. The third continent is the 
      Lands of the Dark Unknown. And the fourth continent is upside down and 
      reversed, but it is the great Serpent Isle, originally known as the Lands 
      of Danger and Despair. <BR><BR>The second map is from the 1996 owo.com 
      website, the original was cut into 2 jpgs. This was the map OSI provided 
      for the pre-alpha testers. As you can see the pre-alpha was a very small 
      portion of the map used today. The map used today was created from 
      scratch, but this pre-alpha map was used as a guide. This explains the 
      differences and similarities found on this map. The map consisted of the 
      city of Britain, farms, orc camps &amp; crypts. Not listed it also 
      included the tower of the evil npc mage Myndon, and the godlands which 
      were outside of the boundary. I will add a very detailed pre-alpha page 
      with screenshots in the future. <BR><BR>The third map is from the 1997 
      owo.com website, it is the original drawing made of the map that would be 
      turned into the cloth map. <BR><BR><FONT color=#a51800 size=4><B>Lord

      alt="Lord British in the 1996 Pre-Alpha Test" 
      src="index_files/british.jpg" align=left>This is Lord British as he was in 
      the 1996 Pre-Alpha Test. His character was made to always hold a maul, it 
      must be his favorite weapon. His character also has a ponytail just like 
      he does in real life. His character has a transparent hole, that's how it 
      was made, up close you can see the cobblestone ground through LB. (Cropped 
      screenshots of LB are from <A href="http://www.moongates.com/">Auric's 
      Ultima Moongates</A> and Newton Dragon. The transparent clear images of LB 
      are thanks to <A href="http://alazane.surf-va.com/">InsideUO by 
      Alazane</A> (a cool program you can use to view UO art). <BR><BR><IMG 
      alt="Lord British in Phase 2 of the Beta Test" 
      src="index_files/british2.jpg" align=left>During Phase 2 of the Beta Test 
      this was the 2nd time I met Lord British in the game. I'm the guy in the 
      green cloak. Lord British is again wielding his favorite weapon the maul. 
      His feet and shadow are cut off by the carpet graphic. It's not a fake 
      screenshot, the carpet graphic was just messed up there back in the beta, 
      but I see in uox that it's currently fixed. <BR><BR><BR><BR><FONT
