<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><IMG height=480 
src="index_files/1100.jpg" width=640 border=0><BR>The first look on the 
paperdoll feature and the character stats window. It was amazing how the figure 
in the paperdoll window matched the appearance on the character in 
game.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=480 src="index_files/1101.jpg" width=640 border=0><BR>
  <FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=2>The old Terathan fort. The big ships have been taken 
  out of the game later, as they caused too much trouble when moved.</FONT></P>
<P><font color="#D90000"><strong>[NOTE: The author does not seem to realize that 
  the above shot is a promotional pre-BETA mockup created by OSI to advertise 
  the game. This NEVER appeared in the pre-alpha, as is plainly visible by the 
  improved graphics.]</strong></font></P>
<P><IMG height=480 src="index_files/1102.jpg" width=640 border=0><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=2><BR>Here you can see the effect of the darkness 
spell, which didn't make it to the release of UO.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=477 src="index_files/1103.jpg" width=638 border=0><BR><FONT 
size=2>Of course there also were lots of obvious bugs in the alpha.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=480 src="index_files/1104.jpg" width=640 border=0><BR><FONT 
size=2>A battle in the wheat field.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=477 src="index_files/1105.jpg" width=638 border=0><BR><FONT 
size=2>People quickly learned that it was an advantage to stick 
together.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=477 src="index_files/1106.jpg" width=639 border=0><BR>
  <FONT 
size=2>A trip to Vesper.</FONT></P>

<P><IMG height=479 src="index_files/1107.jpg" width=637 border=0><BR><FONT 
size=2>Apparently the world-designers made some tests here.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=480 src="index_files/1110.jpg" width=640 border=0><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=2><BR>May 20 1996: This was the last day of the 
Ultima Online pre-alpha test. The character art took a dramatic change for the 
better once beta started many months later. Blackthorn and British surveyed the 
crowd while a half dozen or so summoned orcs made mincemeat. One player was 
asking in perfect roleplaying manner "Why doth thou kill us my lord!" So began 
the historic tradition of killing as many players as possible during official 
gaming events.</FONT></P>
