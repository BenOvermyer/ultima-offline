<h1>Ultima Online Alpha Test</h1>

<p></font size=+1>These</font> all new 36 screenshots were taken during the Ultima Online Alpha Test, also known as

the E3 expo. They are all 640x480 16BIT color JPG files, with a compression of 15%, to enhance image quality. These

images are much sharper than the Pre-Alpha shots, although their average size is now 120-150kb. <p>

<ul>

<li><font size=+2>The Orcish Lords' assult upon Britain</font>

<ul>

<li> Forewarned by advance scouts, the warriors of Britannia gather to face the enemy. <a href="alpha/uoln7.html">jpg</a>

<li>The first wave of Orcish assult troops hath arrived, the long and bloody battle has begun. <a href="alpha/uoln10.html">jpg</a>

<li>Norman the hellhound makes a guest appearance at the battle sight, astonishing the nearby knights. <a href="alpha/uoln11.html">jpg</a>

<li>As the last sounds of battle cease, the dust begins to clear near the bridge stained by the blood of friend and foe. As it becomes clear that the

human forces have won the battle, the piercing scream of a nearby warrior rips through the newly awakened victorious spirit. A sword and shield dance in

the air above the fallen hero, moving swiftly to seek new prey. A soft hiss of displaced air, and another disembodied form arrives... Then another, and another.  <a href="alpha/uoln12.html">jpg</a>

<li> Orcish reinforcements arrive, and the fatigued warriors are pressed back along the bridge towards the city proper. <a href="alpha/uoln13.html">jpg</a>

<li> The dead lay all about us, by now outnumbering the survivors. <a href="alpha/uoln14.html">jpg</a>

</ul>

</ul>



<ul>

of Britannia. <a href="alpha/uoln21.html">jpg</a>

<li> During the eye of the storm, the warriors regroup at the Bridge of Death, preparing for the second wave of Orcish

mauraders. <a href="alpha/uoln22.html">jpg</a>

<li> The battered warriors look on in awe at the great line of Orcish Lords as they cross the Bridge of Death. <font size=-1><b>COOL!</b></font> <a href="alpha/uoln23.html">jpg</a>

</ul>

</ul>



<ul>

<li><font size=+2>The Great Tournament</font>

<ul>

</ul>

</ul>



<ul>

<li><font size=+2>The Conflict at Castle British</font>

<ul>

<li> Evil tidings is whispered among the patrons of the Salty Dog; a large band of mercinaries have begun a large 

scale assult upon Castle British. The knights still loyal to Lord British prepare to defend the castle. <a href="alpha/uoln17.html">jpg</a>

<li> The Pantless Ones hath arrived, the battle begun, the first head hath fallen. <a href="alpha/uoln18.html">jpg</a>

<li> The battle remains close, no side has as of yet a clear advantage over the other.  <a href="alpha/uoln19.html">jpg</a> 

</ul>

</ul>



<ul>

<li> Having safeguarded a key from a Gold Knight, I was lucky enough to lead the very last expidition into the Quest, before

the teleporter mysteriously stopped functioning. Among those who journeyed with me are Sthenalous, Darklin and Kildaren. <a href="alpha/uoln3.html">jpg</a>

<li> Upon hearing rumours of strange happenings at the western tower, a party of adventurers come to investigate. <a href="alpha/uoln4.html">jpg pic 1</a> <a href="alpha/uoln5.html">jpg pic 2</a>

<ul>

<li> The great warriors of Britain gather at Castle British upon hearing the rumour that Lord British himself would make an

appearance. <a href="alpha/uoln36.html">jpg</a>

<li> A foul trap! Once all the warriors had assembled in the castle walls, the gates swung shut and locked behind them. Orcish Lords

began to come out of the woodwork... Or perhaps I should say stonework. Huge gaps begin to appear in the side of Castle

British as an unknown force causes them to explode in flaming fury as the light fades from the world of Britannia... The Ultima

Online Alpha Test has drawn to a close. <a href="alpha/uoln37.html">jpg</a>
