<h1 align="center"><font color="#FFFF80">&quot;The Next Day&quot;</font></h1>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">The
following day I found myself in the town of Britain, selling my
trinkets from the previous night, when I met up with a newcomer.
He was a friendly enough fellow so when he suggested that we head
for the orc fort again, I quickly agreed. It would seem that the
orcs breed faster than rabbits, so I knew the fort would be
filled again with the beasts. Perhaps they have a secret
underground lair where they bring in reinforcements. I do not
know how they become so numerous but there seems to be no end to
them.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">After
selling what I could and preparing for another adventure, my new
companion and I headed off towards the main bridge. The bridge
into Britain was crowded as usual. After surveying my fellow
adventurers for anyone I might know, I saw him again...the fiend
from last night.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">Seeing
him again, my anger quickly flared up anew. The question
&quot;Why?&quot; raced through my mind. What wrong had I done
this man? What reason other than pure malice could he have had
for his behavior?</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">&quot;I
demand an explanation for your attack last night!&quot; I said as
I walked up to him, trying unsuccessfully to hold back my anger.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">He
had been chatting with another warrior and summarily ignored me.
My anger swelled. Finally, after further prompting, he spoke.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4">&quot;What level are
you?&quot; he asked.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">I was
flabbergasted. Was he still trying to determine my weaknesses?
After his behavior last night, I was not about to give him the
leg up on me.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4">&quot;What level are
you?&quot; I retorted not expecting an answer.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4">He paused for a moment
before answering me.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4">&quot;19th,&quot; he
responded.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4">19th?!? After having
fought him last night, I was convinced that he was higher than
that. There seemed no end to his treachery.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4">&quot;So what level are
you?&quot; he asked again.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4">&quot;69th,&quot; I said,
trying not to sound too boastful.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4">&quot;BS!&quot; he said.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4">He didn't believe me?
Fine. Some guys just don't know when to quit.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4">&quot;Do you want to try
me?&quot; I retorted before I could restrain myself.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">At
this point, even my new companion seemed to doubt that I was
telling the truth. Either that or he was eager to see a battle.
&quot;Go ahead, try him,&quot; he instigated.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">Before
I could say another word, the fiend backed up a couple of steps
and began throwing fireballs at me again trying to gain a quick
edge. That was enough for me. I moved in, trying to leave him no
avenue for escape this time. He was backed up against the edge of
the bridge. There were no trees to aid his flight this time.
Having just left the healer in town, I was ready. There was no
escape...</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">And
so the battle had begun. It was a fierce fight. Though the great
axe is not an elegant weapon, it gets the job done. We exchanged
many hits, but it was quickly apparent who the victor would be.
Sensing this, I thought he would once again flee, trying to
escape me, but this time he did not. Perhaps he understood that
he had this coming. He had attacked one of his kin and now he had
to pay the price. How many other innocent people had he attacked?
People who could not defend themselves? I gave him a lesson in
justice that day. He stood and took his punishment, and in that
moment, perhaps he learned a little about honor as well. I sent
him to the temple to begin a new life and gathered my prize, but
I hoped even more that in his next life these events would touch
him and he would think twice before attacking unprovoked.</font></font></p>
