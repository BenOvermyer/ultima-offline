Unprovoked&quot;</font></h1>

time known to many of us as 'the first test' was a chaotic and
deadly time. The lands of Britannia were only beginning to form.
Orcs roamed the land within a stones throw of the great castle.
Even the sanctuary of our fallen comrades was overrun with evil,
now stalked by the bones of man and beast long dead, rising up to
torment us once more. These were wicked times, when the hearts of
many had become tainted with the desire for power. To test their
strength against their brothers and prove that they were indeed
the strongest. Through the slaughter of countless innocents, men
grew in power and skill. Apparently unsatisfied with the
countless evils around them, these men took it upon themselves to
add to this evil. I had the misfortune of meeting a man such as
this. Herein you will learn the cowardly ways of these men,
hell-bent on destruction.</font></font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">As
night approached, the sky darkened. It was getting late, and as
such most of my companions had headed off to rest up for the
morrow. So I was once again left alone to wander this wonderful,
deadly realm. As always, the foul orcs were stirring up trouble
in their camp, the fort to the southwest. Not being one to wait
for trouble to come to me, I set my sights on these unsavory
beasts. Packing up all the equipment I thought I'd need, I began
the journey to their stench-filled lair.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF8080"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">Finally
I came to the farmhouse on the outskirts of the forest. This was
the last bastion of peace loving folk before my path so I decided
to stay for a moment and chat with the friendly peasants. After
hearing of my plans to raid the orc fort, the farmer's eyes
filled with fear. He talked of the retribution the orcs would
take on their home for my audacity. He feared for my life as
well, but I understood, his family came first. I tried my best to
comfort them and reassure them, but I could not blame them for
their fears. Orcs are not choosy when looking for a target for
their vengeance. I chastised myself for playing the braggart and
causing such strife within this family. I promised myself I would
not make the same mistake again.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">After
saying farewell to these good people, doing what I could to
reassure them, I headed towards the forest. The huts outside the
fort served as watch posts and would be my first target, but the
orcs were very cunning and might have lookouts in the woods
searching for intruders. This was not my first time here and I
knew the area well. Carefully, I made my way through the trees.
Silence...there were no orcs to be found. The orcs have learned
our habits well. Perhaps they have let down their defenses
thinking that we would not dare attack at night when our numbers
are so few. &quot;If so,&quot; I thought, &quot;this would be
their last mistake.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF8080"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">As I
reached the first outpost, I spied a few of the hairy beasts just
inside their hut. So, they had not let their guard down after
all. No matter, I was ready. I let slip an audible groan of
disappointment as I realized that none of the dreaded orc leaders
(or captains, as they are better known) were in sight. Hearing my
groan, the nearest orc let out a grunt of warning and rushed in
to attack. He reacted too slowly, however and I quickly
dispatched the beasts before they could alert their brethren
inside the monstrous fort. That's when it began...</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">After
having dispatched my enemies, I proceeded to relieve the foul
beasts of their coinage. &quot;They wouldn't be needing it any
longer,&quot; I chuckled. As I searched my fallen opponents, I
suddenly felt a sharp pain and a wave of heat rushed over me.
&quot;What was that?&quot; I stuttered as I looked around for the
source of my pain. Seeing no one in the immediate vicinity, I
brushed it off thinking that I must have imagined it. Soon after,
it hit me again! This time I was alert and I was sure that it had
not been my imagination. Then I saw him...</font></font></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p align="left"><img src="images/fireball.jpg" align="bottom"
width="200" height="100"></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">Just
within my vision, crouched behind the orc hut, I saw a man. He
was in full plate armor, but his outfit was very distinctive,
kilt and all. He was definitely not one of the evil marauding
knights plaguing the land. At first he just seemed to be
crouching there so I mimicked the actions of one still searching
for orc possessions as if I hadn't yet noticed him. Then he began
to move his arms in an almost hypnotic fashion. Almost
immediately I recognized the incantation for the deadly fireball
spell. Having all the proof that I required, I headed in his
direction in an attempt to question him.</font></font></p>
<p align="right"><img src="images/me&amp;orcs.jpg" align="bottom"
width="159" height="90"></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4">&quot;What do you think
you're doing??&quot; I fumed.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">As
soon as he saw me coming he took a few steps back, not wanting to
face his prey in such close quarters. Refusing to answer, he
continued his barrage of sorcery trying to slaughter me before I
had even attacked. Finally, I pulled out my cold steel and rushed
the fiend. Seeing my anger, he quickly turned and dashed off into
the woods. I gave chase but within seconds he was gone.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">Thinking
that he had learned his lesson, I went back to the task at hand.
It was then that I realized that a few more orcs had come out of
the fort and were examining the bodies of their fallen comrades.
I had to act quickly or I would have the entire orc population on
my heals. Luck was on my side for they had not yet noticed me in
the shadows. I jumped the newcomers, taking them by surprise. The
final beast barely had time to let out a howl before his carcass
hit the ground.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">This
was better. I was focused once again on my quarry. The events of
a moment ago were nearly forgotten. I was ready to destroy the
entire orc village if need be. Setting myself to the task, I once
again searched the bodies of my fallen opponents, taking what was
mine by the code of battle. Reaching over, I noticed him
again...creeping just within the limits of my vision. The
scoundrel had returned! I was taken aback. This time, I hesitated
only long enough to be sure it was the same man. Almost
immediately he began his incantations, signaling what was to
come. No more questioning, I had had enough.</font></font></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p align="right"><img src="images/firebll2.jpg" align="bottom"
width="200" height="100"></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">This
time, he did not immediately run off. Apparently he had taken
just enough time to heal himself and was ready for an all out
duel. Luck nor good judgment was with him this day as I got the
best of him. Soon he realized the battle had turned against him
and he once again decided to flee into the woods. I was prepared,
however, and this time I was not going to let him escape so
easily. &quot;If he wants a fight, I'll give him one!&quot; I
thought.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><img src="images/me&amp;orcs.jpg" align="bottom"
width="159" height="90"></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">Maneuvering
through trees, luck finally turned in his favor, and he was able
to evade me. This time I would not so easily forget and if he did
not know this, then he was indeed a fool.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF80"><font size="4"><img
src="images/space.gif" align="bottom" width="25" height="5">After
convincing myself that he was gone for the night, I headed back
to the fort. Surely the orcs would be ready now though. My battle
cries at their front door were probably heard by Lord British
himself all the way back at the castle. No matter, I had a job to
do and was in dire need of venting my frustration. Before that
night was over, not a single orc was left standing.</font></font></p>
