get permission from those adventurers who learned of the magic
known as &quot;<em>screen capture</em>&quot; before I did. Enjoy!</p>

<p><font size="5">T</font>he following shot was taken in the land
of the &quot;<strong>Gods</strong>&quot;. I was teleported there

we were kept penned up to prevent mischief.</p>

<p><font size="5">H</font>ere is a shot on the &quot;Bridge of
Death&quot;. Aptly named I may add! I am the one in the orangish
armor and black skirt facing Dragonslayer, with the red shield,
axe, no helm, and white skirt. This was mostly a goodbye day.</p>

<p><font size="5">T</font>his shot shows many of us at the BOD. I
have my paperdoll, backpack, and status scrollbar open. As you
can see, my backpack is quite full with offerings I will leave at
the Temple for the benefit of the needy. I enjoyed helping out
the newer adventurers all throughout the game as DragonSlayer did
with me on my first day.</p>
