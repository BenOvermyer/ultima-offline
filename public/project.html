              <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>What can we do 
              with the UO pre-alpha client?</strong></font> <br> 
              <font color="#FFFFCC" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>For those of 
              us who played the pre-alphas, or those of you who wanted to, here's 
              our chance at playing them again.</strong></font> <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">How 
                will we do that?</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
                <font color="#FFFFCC">I see (2) options for having a playable 
                pre-alpha again:<br>
                <br>
                1. Writing a server system (much like UOX, Greyworld, TUS, Sphere, 
                etc etc) that would use the pre-alpha client in situ. While this 
                might be the best way of getting the most out of the pre-alpha 
                client, I don't think its the most efficient nor time-saving way.</font></font></strong></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFCC"><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. 
                Modifying one of the existing server systems, like Sphere, to 
                &quot;play&quot; like the pre-alpha. This is easily possible by 
                creating the pre-alpha's tiny custom map based on existing screenshots 
                and memories of ex-alpha testers. Next, the existing &quot;release&quot; 
                UO client would have to be modified by replacing its animations, 
                tiles, music and sound with graphics &amp; audio from the pre-alpha 
                client. This might be possible by extracting them out of the pre-alpha 
                client, and then importing them into the release client.</font></strong></font></p>
              <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Technical 
                Barriers</font><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
                </font><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
                are quite a few technical problems that stand in the way of getting 
                a working pre-alpha game going (in no particular order):<br>
                <br>
                1. Having InsideUO or some similar utility to read graphics (tilesets, 
                monster animations, gumps, etc) from the pre-alpha client. Currently, 
                InsideUO seems capable of extracting the WAV audio from the client 
                without any problem. MIDI files already exist in a subfolder of 
                the pre-alpha client, so they present no particular problem.</font></strong></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFCC"><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 2. Choosing 
                a server system as a foundation for the game. Sphere seems like 
                a good choice due to its deep customizability and simplicity of 
                scripting.</font></strong></font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFCC"><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. Creating 
                a custom map with Sphere and Dragon that reasonably matches the 
                pre-alpha map. This can be based on the existing overhead view 
                map of the pre-alpha, as a hundred screenshots of varying areas 
                of the game.</font></strong></font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFCC"><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">4. The pre-alpha 
                system was based on Experience, not skill levels. Sphere would 
                have to be modified to play an Experience-based character system. 
                That doesn't present much of a problem luckily, since many people 
                have already done this with Sphere.</font></strong></font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFCC"><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">5. Gumps would 
                have to be modified with Sphere to reflect the old client's Gumps.</font></strong></font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFCC"><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">6. Inserting 
                all existing graphical data into the release UO client. I assume 
                this can be done with a combination of utilities out there, although 
                I'm not sure if monster animations will import very well.</font></strong></font></p>
              <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why does this 
                site exist?</font><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
                </font><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
                anything, just to archive most of the dying information out there 
                on this old relic of a game. It took about 25 hours of searching 
                Google, and archive.org for traces of UO pre-alpha information. 
                Most screenshots have been archived, although some are still missing 
                (ie. Chandar's). It took 2 years to find the pre-alpha client 
                itself (yes, 2 years!). If a pre-alpha project actually got going, 
                this would be the place to get started.</font></strong></p>

                get more information?</font><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
